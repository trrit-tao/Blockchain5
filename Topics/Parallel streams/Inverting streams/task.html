<h2>Inverting streams</h2>
<p></p><p>There is a new challenge. Someone has not correctly chosen the types of streams in a program (parallel and sequential).</p><p>You need to implement a method that inverts the state of every stream from the given list (parallel â†’ sequential and vice versa).</p><p>The method should return a new list of streams which are inverted.</p><p>Try to use streams to solve this problem.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
